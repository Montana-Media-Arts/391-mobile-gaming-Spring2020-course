In this homework, you are going to build our simple application outlined at the beginning of the week. You are going to develop the front-end, save all the data in a file, and then print out the result on a second page.

1. Get the user's first name.
2. Get the user's last name.
    - it is essential to separate the first name and last name so we can store them and find them more easily later.
3. Let the user choose their arrival date.
4. Let the user select their departure date.
5. After the user makes all the selections, allow them to click the submit button.
6. All data should be written to a file.
7. The user should go to another page.
8. The data entered on the first page should appear on the second.
9. Turn in your project and your .apk.
