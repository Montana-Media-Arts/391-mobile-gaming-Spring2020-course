# Homework

In this homework, you are going to build our simple application outlined at the beginning of the week. You are going to build the front-end, save all the data in a file and then print out the result on a second page.

1. Get the user's first name.
2. Get the user's last name.
    - it is important to separate the first name and last name so we can store them and find them easier.
3. Let the user choose their arrival date.
4. Let the user choose their departure date.
5. Once everything is chosen, click the submit button.
6. All data should be written to a file.
7. The user should go to another page.
