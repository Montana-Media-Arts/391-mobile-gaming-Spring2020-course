We are going to use the Community version of Visual Studio since it is free and can be installed on all platforms.  If you already have Visual Studio, feel free to stay with it.  If not, below are the directions on getting it.

1. Go to [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. Click on **Free Download**.
3. When the**Save As** dialog box appears, either stay in the current directory or change it before pressing **Save**.
4. Once the installer is downloaded, click on the .exe and allow the installer to finish downloading and installing the initial components.
5. Then, when you get to the **Installation** dialog, click on at least the **Mobile Development with .NET** checkbox.
6. Click on **Install**.

* Depending on your internet connection, this can take a while since it's 6+ GB.

7. If you have a Microsoft Account, feel free to sign in otherwise, please register a new account.

Once you have it installed, you can move on and create a new project.
