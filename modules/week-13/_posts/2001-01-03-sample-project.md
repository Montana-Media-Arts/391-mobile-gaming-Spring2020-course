Now that we know how to create a project, let's create something simple that allows us to take in some user input, store it and then display it on a different screen.  Just like anything, we should sketch out what we plan on doing and then work on each piece.

For example, I want to create project that allows users to register for your VRBO (Vacation Rental By Owner) and even have a profile picture (pre-determined for now).  How will we do that?  We need to determine what to capture. Let's create the requirements.

1. Get the user's first name.
2. Get the user's last name.
    - it is important to separate the first name and last name so we can store them and find them easier.
3. Let the user choose their arrival date.
4. Let the user choose their departure date.
5. Let the user choose an avatar.

Okay we have the idea, so now, how are we going to make it a reality in this format?  Go to the next section and we will talk about XAML basics to see how we implement this.
