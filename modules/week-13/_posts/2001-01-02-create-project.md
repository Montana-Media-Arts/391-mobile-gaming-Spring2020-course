# Create a New Project

Xamarin gives us several options when creating a new project. We can create projects that are focused directly on the Android or iOS operating systems.  We can also create projects allowing us to create applications for both.  We are going to create a project that works for both.

1. In the **Project** Window, click on **Create a new project**.
2. In the list of projects, select **Mobile App (Xamarin.Forms)**.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Give the project a **name, a Location, and a Solution name**.
5. Click **Create**.
6. If a **Windows Security Alert** dialog appears, click **Allow access**.
7. In the **New Cross-Platform Add** dialog box, click **Blank**.
8. Click **Next**.
9. If correctly starts, you should have a .xaml page that says "Welcome to Xamarin.Forms"
10. Run the progam on your device or in an emulator.
