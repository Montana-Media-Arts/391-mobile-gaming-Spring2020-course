# Compiling

Since this is a native Android, application, we can compile fairly easily.  We still want to set the backgound images, icons, etc., however, they can be added later.

To compile, an application, do the following.

1. Go to Build -> Build Bundle(s)/APK(s).
2. It should tell you that you created an APK success.
3. In the lower right hand corner, it should tell you how to locate it.

Install it somewhere and make sure it runs.
