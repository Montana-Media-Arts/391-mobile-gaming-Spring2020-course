Since this is a native Android application, we can compile reasonably easily.  We still want to set background images, icons, etc., which can be added later.

To compile an application, do the following.

1. Go to **Build -> Build Bundle(s)/APK(s)**.
2. It should tell you that you created an APK success.
3. In the lower **right-hand** corner, it should tell you how to locate it.

Install it somewhere and make sure it runs.
