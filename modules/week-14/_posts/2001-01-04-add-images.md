We want to create something a little more fun this time.  So, let's add an image to our project that we can move around the screen.

First, either create a new image or find one online.  Make sure it has a transparent background, or it will look kind of odd.

1. Open the **main_activity.xml**.  
2. Find an **ImageView** and drag that onto the interface.
3. In the **Pick a Resource** dialog window, click on the **plus** sign and choose **Import Drawables**. 
4. Find your image and then click **Next**. Make sure the name of your image is in all lower case.  
5. It should then populate the **ImageView**.  You may want to set the **image constraints** of where you want it to appear as well as have some **contentDescription**.
