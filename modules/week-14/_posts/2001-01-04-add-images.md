# Add Images to Our Project

We want to create something a little more fun this time.  So, let's add an image to our project that we can move around the screen.

First, either create a new image or find one online.  Make sure it has a transparent background or it will look kind of odd.

1. Open the main_activity.xml.  
2. Find a ImageView and drag that onto the interface.
3. In the Pick a Resource dialog window, click on the **plus** sign and choose **Import Drawables**. 
4. Find your image and then click next. Make sure the name of your image is in all lower case.  
5. It should then populate the ImageView.  You may want to set the image constraints of where you want it to appear as well as have some contentDescription.  However, it will still appear either.
