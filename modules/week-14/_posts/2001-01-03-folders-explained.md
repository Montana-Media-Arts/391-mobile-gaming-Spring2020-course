Just like any project, Android Studio has a number of folders that are created.  Let's take a look at what they contain.

## manifests

This where the global AndroidManifest.xml file exists. This is where the original settings for the minimum SDK, permissions and other general settings are stored.

## java

This folder contains all the code specific files.  For example, our MainActivity.java file is here.  This is the code that is run to make our application appear.  We will make changes to this file later.

## res

There are a nubmer of subfolders in this folder, but there is where all the resources are.  So, the launching backgrounds, the layouts for different screens, icons, global variables are all contained in files here.

So, overall, not too bad. But it's good to know what the hierarchy is.

Let's look in the emulator.  Did it work? Great!  Now, let's add an image.
