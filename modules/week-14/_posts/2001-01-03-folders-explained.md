Just like any project, Android Studio creates several folders when generating a project.  Let's take a look at what they contain.

## manifests

The manifest folder contains the global AndroidManifest.xml file. This file is where the original settings for the minimum SDK, permissions, and other general settings are stored.

## java

This folder contains all the code specific files.  For example, our MainActivity.java file is here.  This main file contains code that runs the application.  We will make changes to this file later.

## res

There are several subfolders in this folder, but there is where all the resources are.  So, the launching backgrounds, the layouts for different screens, icons, global variables are all contained in files here.

So, overall, not too bad. But it's good to know what the hierarchy is.

Let's look at the emulator.  Did it work? Great!  Now, let's add an image.
