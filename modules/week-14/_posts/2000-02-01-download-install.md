By now, you should have Android Studio installed. However, the following provides instructions on how to get it installed.

1. Download the Android Studio. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) - it is significant in size, and it takes a long time, but honestly, it's much easier than trying to install the SDK and then the emulators.  
2. Once downloaded, click on the .exe or the dmg to install the program.  It is compatible with PCs and Macs.

## SDK 

1. Next, if you do not have an SDK installed, go into the SDK manager by going to **Tools -> SDK Manager**.  If that option doesn't exist, then go to **File -> Settings -> System -> Android SDK**.
2. Choose an SDK that targets the majority of the users currently.
3. Click **OK**.

## AVD

1. If you do not have an AVD installed, then create one that is compatible with your APK.
2. Go to **Tools -> AVD Manager**.  If that isn't available, go to **File -> Settings** and search for **AVD**. You may need to install **Android SDK Support**.  If not, you can look for the AVD icon right below the file menu.
3. Once you are in the **AVD Manager**, create a new emulator supporting whichever APKs installed.

Now, you are ready to go.  Let's create our first project.
