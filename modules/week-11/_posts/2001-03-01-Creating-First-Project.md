# Making our first project

Now, that we have cordova and either Android or iOS installed, let's see if we can get it all to work correctly.

Go into your command prompt or terminal and create a new project.

Then, navigate to the project folder and go into the .html file.

Make changes to it, save it and recompile.  Did your changes appear?  Great!

Now, create a couple more pages and make sure you can link them together.  Keep in mind, by default Cordova projects look at the index.html page as the starting page.

If you are unsure of how HTML, CSS and JavaScript, work, let's go to the next page and I will give you resources and activities to learn them.
