# Download Unity

Unity uses what is called the Unity Hub now to install versions of Unity.  The Unity Hub is useful because it allows you to have different versions of Unity which is important because it allows you to support projects from today as well as ones from years ago.

1. First go to Unity [Unity] (https://unity.com/)
2. Next, Click on Games
3. Click on Get Started.
4. Click the Individual Tab.
5. Click the Student or Individual Sign up Button.
6. If you choose Individual, click Start Here.
7. Click Agree and Download.
8. After the download is complete, install Unity Hub.


# Install Unity

Once you have the Unity Hub, you can install different versions of Unity.  I recommend the latest one.


1. In the Unity Hub, click Installs.
2. Click Add.
3. Select the most recent version (should be on top) and click Next.
4. In the Add Modules window, select either Windows or iOS.
5. Click Done.

Wait for the install and then click on Projects.

1. Click New.
2. In the Create New Project, click 2D Template.
3. In the Project Name, enter Playground Fun.
4. Click Create.
