# iOS Environment

The main thing you need to know is that you need an Mac for this to work.  Unfortunately, there is no way to emulate a Mac on a PC (legally anyway).  

If you have a Mac, then you can fairly easily create the iOS environment.  If you want to run it through Cordova, there are just a few commands.  However, I would recommend accessing, downloading XCode as well.  This will make deploying much easier.

If you want to deploy to the store, you will need a developer license.  You can access this here.

It does $99/year so you have to consider if you are okay with that.

With all the hard work in place, let's move onto Cordova.
