# HTML

For those of you who think HTML is scary, never fear, it is not.  Here is the crash course for all these technologies.  Keep in mind HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is where we put our content.

# CSS

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets are what give our HTML pages their look and feel.  These are important because we can create a single page that affect multiple pages.

# JavaScript

JavaScript is what gives our pages functionality.  So, it's the programming part of this system.  We need JavaScript so that we can check to see if a textbox is empty, determine what to do when a button is clicked, send data to another computer and more.

This section is not meant to provide all the details, however, you will learn HTML and CSS in MART 341 (if you haven't already taken it) and you will JavaScript and jQuery in 441.

However, here are some great references from W3Schools that I like.

1. [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - this is a good one because it starts at the beginning and walks you through what the tags are why they are meaningful.
2. [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - again this shows you what CSS is and how to effectively use it.
3. [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - finally, this tutorial walks through how to use JavaScript successfully.  

If you are unfamiliar, I would highly recommend going through at least a few sections as you will need it for your homework.
