# HTML


For those of you who think HTML is scary, never fear, it is not.  Here is the crash course for all these technologies.  Keep in mind HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  It is where we put our content.

# CSS

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets are what gives our HTML pages their look and feel.  These are important because we can create a single page that affects multiple pages.

# JavaScript

JavaScript is what provides the functionality of our page.  So, it's the programming part of this system.  We need JavaScript to determine if a textbox is empty, to handle a button click, send data to another computer, and more.

This section does not provide all the details; however, you will learn HTML and CSS in MART 341 (if you haven't already taken it), and you will JavaScript and jQuery in 441.

However, here are some excellent references from W3Schools that I like.

1. [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - this is a good one because it starts at the beginning and walks you through what the tags are why they are meaningful.
2. [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - again, this shows you what CSS is and how to use it effectively.
3. [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - finally, this tutorial walks through how to use JavaScript successfully.  

If you are unfamiliar, I would highly recommend going through at least a few sections as you will need it for your homework.
