# Homework

In this homework, you are going to experiment with Cordova and make sure you can create at least an android application.  If you have only a Mac that is okay, you should still be able to install and emulate an Android application from your machine. You are going to create a small application that displays what you plan on doing this time of social distancing.  You should have at three pages that show all the ways you plan on doing this.  The pages must link to one another, use a style sheet and incorporate JavaScript. How you do it is up to you.

## Technical Specfications

* Create a Cordova Application
* Have at least 3 pages
* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Link the 3 pages together
* Have at least one image per page.
* Compile using Cordova and create an Android APK.
* Turn in all pages and your APK.
