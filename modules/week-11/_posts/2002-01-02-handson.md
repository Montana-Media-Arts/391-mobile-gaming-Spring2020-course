# Hands On Activities

What's important in any of these lessons is trying stuff out.  Now that you know how to add an **enemy** try creating a new one and have it also collide, cause damage and then destruct after colliding.

Next, if you feel ambitious, see if you can get the obstacles to rotate while falling. Have at least 3 obstacles.
