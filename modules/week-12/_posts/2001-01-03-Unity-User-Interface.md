# Unity User Interface

## Heirarchy

The first window is the hierarchy tab.  This window is where any added components to the scene appear.

## Project

The Project Tab is where all your assets appear.  Remember when you imported the assets from the store?  This tab contains all images, audio, prefabs, and other assets.  You access your assets here and drag them into the scene window.

## Scene

In the Scene window, this is like the design window.  It allows you to arrange items added to the scene before previewing it.

## Add an item to the scene

Let's add something to the scene.  Go into the Project section, and expand the BayatGames -> Free Platform Game Assets -> Backgrounds -> png -> 1920x1080 -> Background.  Drag the background into the  Scene.  You will see it in the Scene as well as in the Hierarchy.

## Does it run?

In the upper part of the window, click on the run button, and see if it works. You should see the background appear.  Not too exciting, though.

## Inspector

One more window that is important in Unity is the Inspector window.  The Inspector window is where we add components to our objects.

Now, let's add more components to the background.
