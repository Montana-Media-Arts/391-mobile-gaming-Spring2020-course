In this assignment, you are going to create a simple Unity platform game. You can use whatever assets you want. If you're going to use the ones that are in the store, that is fine. If you're going to use yours, that is fine too. Just make the user move around on the platform and then at least build an Android application. I know I keep having you develop Android apps, but it's easier for PC and Mac users since they can both build Android applications.

1. Use Unity to build a simple platformer.
2. No need for a score or health unless you want to implement it.
3. Must have a tilemap.
4. Must have a player that moves; no animation required unless you want to implement it.
5. The make the player jump over obstacles with the space bar.
6. Compile your application for Android.
7. Upload the project and .apk to your repository. If it's too big, put it in Box and upload the link to Box.
