# Unity

If you have never used Unity, there is a few things in which we should be aware.  However, we just have to cover a few of the interface components so that we are all on the same page.  First, we need to download Unity.

## Download Unity

Unity uses centralized software called the Unity Hub, allowing users to install different versions of Unity on the same machine.  The Unity Hub allows you to support today's projects from today as well as ones in the future or even previous projects.

1. First go to Unity [Unity] (https://unity.com/)
2. Next, Click on Games
3. Click on Get Started.
4. Click the Individual Tab.
5. Click the Student or Individual Sign up Button.
6. If you choose Individual, click Start Here.
7. Click Agree and Download.
8. After the download is complete, install Unity Hub.


## Install Unity

Once you have the Unity Hub, you can install different versions of Unity.  I recommend the latest one.


1. In the Unity Hub, click Installs.
2. Click Add.
3. Select the most recent version (should be on top) and click Next.
4. In the Add Modules window, select either Windows or iOS.
5. Click Done.

Wait for the install and then click on Projects.

1. Click New.
2. In the Create New Project, click 2D Template.
3. In the Project Name, enter any name that sounds good to you.
4. Click Create.
